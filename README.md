# About Kotlin Multiplatform
This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, Web.

* [/composeApp](./composeApp/src) is a Kotlin Multiplatform library containing shared code across all platforms.
  It contains several subfolders:
    - [commonMain](./composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin) is for code that's common for all targets.
    - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
      For example, if you want to use Apple's CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
      the [iosMain](./composeApp/src/iosMain/kotlin) folder would be the right place for such calls.
      Similarly, if you want to edit the Desktop (JVM) specific part, the [jvmMain](./composeApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin)
      folder is the appropriate location.

* [/androidApp](./androidApp) contains the Android application. This is a separate module that depends on the
  `/composeApp` library and serves as the entry point for the Android app.

* [/iosApp](./iosApp/iosApp) contains iOS applications. Even if you're sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform,
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

### Build and Run Android Application

To build and run the development version of the Android app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE's toolbar or build it directly from the terminal:

- on macOS/Linux
  ```shell
  ./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :androidApp:assembleDebug
  ```

### Build and Run Web Application

To build and run the development version of the web app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE's toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:

- for the Wasm target (faster, modern browsers):
    - on macOS/Linux
      ```shell
      ./gradlew :composeApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun
      ```
    - on Windows
      ```shell
      .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun
      ```
- for the JS target (slower, supports older browsers):
    - on macOS/Linux
      ```shell
      ./gradlew :composeApp:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun
      ```
    - on Windows
      ```shell
      .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun
      ```

### Build and Run iOS Application

To build and run the development version of the iOS app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE's toolbar or open the [/iosApp](./iosApp) directory in Xcode and run it from there.

Alternatively, you can build from the terminal:
```shell
xcodebuild -project iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj -scheme iosApp -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build
```

Note: iOS development requires Xcode and macOS. For running on a device or simulator, using Xcode is recommended.
